        <h3 class="font-bold text-xl">Why is OCR important?</h3>
        <p class="text-sm">OCR technology solves the problem by converting text images into text data that can be
            analyzed by other business software. You can then use the data to conduct analytics, streamline operations,
            automate processes, and improve productivity.</p>

        <h3 class="font-bold text-xl">How does OCR work?</h3>
        <p class="text-sm font-bold mt-4">The following steps are involved in OCR:</p>
        <ol class="text-sm list-decimal px-4">
            <li class="mt-2"><span class="font-bold">Image Acquisition</span>: The source document or image is scanned
                or captured using a digital camera or
                scanner, converting it into a digital image.</li>
            <li class="mt-2"><span class="font-bold">Preprocessing</span>: The OCR software performs various operations
                to enhance the image quality and remove any
                noise or artifacts. This may include deskewing (correcting tilted images), despeckling (removing small
                dots or imperfections), and enhancing contrast and brightness.</li>
            <li class="mt-2"><span class="font-bold">Text Recognition</span>: The OCR engine analyzes the processed
                image to recognize and interpret the text within
                it. There are two main approaches used for text recognition ( Pattern Matching & Feature Extraction)
            <li class="mt-2"><span class="font-bold">Postprocessing</span>: Once the text has been recognized, the OCR
                software performs additional processing to
                refine the extracted text. This may include spell-checking, error correction, and formatting
                adjustments.</li>

            <li class="mt-2"><span class="font-bold">Output</span>: The final output of the OCR process is the extracted
                text, which can be saved as a searchable
                and editable document format such as PDF, Word, or plain text. Some OCR systems also provide options to
                preserve the original layout and formatting of the source document.</li>
